# FinalProject
Predict outcome based on sports data.

## On 19th July 2021:

I deleted the rows with data up to year 2003 from the .csv files and kept data only 2004 onward up to 2021 except the *all_players.csv* had data up to 2020.

Saved the new .csv files as,

- all_goalkeepers_2004to2021.csv
- all_players_2004to2020.csv
- all_tables_2004to2021.csv
- matches_2004to2021.csv

Original .csv files are also there in the **Resources** folder. 

## All the relevant files for Segment-2 is copied and kept in a folder named "Segment_2".
