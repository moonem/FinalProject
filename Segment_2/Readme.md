## Presentation

### Selected Topic

The topic has been selected as **"Win/Loss Prediction in Major League Soccer using Deep Learning model"**.

### Reason behind choosing this topic

Our team decided on this project because our home city, Austin, Texas, recently got its first MLS soccer club. **Austin FC**, a new member of the Western Conference, has had a hot start to the 2021 season. We wanted to dig into the historic perforamance of rival clubs and develop a **machine learning model** to predict outcomes for our home team's first season.
